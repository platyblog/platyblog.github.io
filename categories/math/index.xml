      <description>A reddit user, /u/INL_TT, has recently proposed a few problems to be solved using your favourite proof assistant. The last one has been particularly interesting:coq-math-problems.
The problem is taken from a paper by Coquand and Spiwack1 investigating ways to formalise in a constructivist context the notion of finite set. A common caracterisation of a finite set A is the impossibility to inject the natural numbers into A. Or phrased differently, any stream of elements of A contains a duplicate.</description>

      <description>I never quite understood why all the crazy magic in this post actually works, nor did I manage to grok Escardo&amp;rsquo;s paper. But I will try to write what I understood so far.
Escardo shows that the Cantor space ($\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{B}$ where $\mathbb{B}$ is the set of booleans) admits exhaustive search, meaning that for any total predicate $\varphi$, it is possible to find a witness $w$ such that $\varphi(w)$ is true or show that such a witness doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in finite time.</description>
